Since then, I've completed a master's degree in Human Pose Estimation and Ph.D. in Pedestrian Tracking and Collective Behavior Recognition. In 2015, I co-founded a company that provided many CV solutions, including OCR, face biometrics, logo detection and license plate recognition. A couple of years ago this company was acquired (acqui-hired) by an unicorn startup.","location":{"countryCode":"US","address":"Brazil"},"profiles":[{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"gustavo-führ-a713a67a","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-führ-a713a67a/"},{"network":"Twitter","username":"gustfuhr","url":"https://twitter.com/gustfuhr"}]},"work":[{"name":"unico IDtech","position":"Senior Machine Learning Engineer","startDate":"2020-07-31","endDate":"2024-01-31","highlights":[],"summary":"- Working as the ML tech lead for large-scale face recognition and liveness systems, building models based on state-of-the-art algorithms. \n- Manage most of the Machine Learning initiatives of the company creating internal challenges, experiment and code standards.\n- Responsible for the ML tech roadmap and the company's partnership with the university.","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/37423521","location":"Brazil"},{"name":"Meerkat - Soluções em Visão Computacional","position":"Machine Learning Engineer (CTO)","startDate":"2015-06-30","endDate":"2020-07-31","highlights":[],"summary":"Co-founded a startup focused in Computer Vision products.
